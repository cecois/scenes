# Scenes

These dialogues are largely\* fictional transactions between largely real people who, for one reason or another, seem interesting and whom, to one degree or another, are likely to have participated as imagined.

\* At least one piece is presented here *verbatim* (and uncredited for effect) from a primary source.
